This role installs Jupyter (previously ipython notebook), JupyterHub and sudospawner using Python 3.
 
It was developed and tested with Ubuntu 15.04, but should work on any recent Ubuntu or Debian.
As of 2017-02 it has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04LTS Xenial as well.

This was tested on Scaleways (scaleway.com) and Digital Ocean. So it *does* work on ARM!

JupyterHub is installed as per instructions, with node.js and configurable-http-proxy.

To add a user, login to the server as root:

    adduser <username>
    addgroup <username> jupyter

for existed user, you must add the user to jupyter goupr

Then connect via web browser

    http://<ip address>:8000

To run, install ansible, configure your ssh/config file for a host "jupyterhub" and use one of the following:

    ansible-playbook ansible-jupyterhub/playbook/no_ssl.yml -i <hostfile>
    ansible-playbook ansible-jupyterhub/playbook/with_ssl.yml -i <hostfile>
 
Note: During testing on linode I ran into IPV6 issues. Nothing to do with
jupyterhub or ansible, but apt wouldn't work with IPV6 enabled on Xenial. I
disabled IPV6 according to these instructions and apt (and ansible) began to
work. If it hangs on installing packages this is probably your issue.

Also on Ubuntu 16.10 I had to do a "apt install python-minimal" to get python
2 for ansible. 

When everything has finished you should be able to point your browser at:

http://ip.add:8000

And then login as jupyter with the password you entered at the start.
